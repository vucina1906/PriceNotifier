- I created this app to track prices for products of interest on my favourite site KupujemProdajem (https://novi.kupujemprodajem.com/)

1. To use this app first you need to enter app.py file and after that write your email address on marked places where it is written 'youremailadress'. 

2. Then you need to create app password in you google account. Go to google account than settings nad allow 2 step verification process. After you done 2 step verification process you will get additional option for app password (it will show under 2 step verification or you will have to enter 2 step verification menu and find it at the bottom). Then generate new unique password for this app. After you get password paste it to place 'yourapspassword' in app.py script. 

3. Last step you need to do to customize this app for your usage is to find out your user agent. It will depend of the browser you use. Go to link httpbin.org/get and paste user agent you find there in app.py script code where us written "your user agent" and the rest stay the same in a sctipt. 

4. To use this sctipt for other sites of your interest you need also to update function check price and to check for speciffic classes that site uses in their HTML to present product price.
